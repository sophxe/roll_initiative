# ROLL INITIATIVE

A simple Python script to determine the order of initiative in D&D from inputted player names and initiative rolls:

Please note, the script does not determine tiebreakers with initiative modifiers in the event of a matched roll - it will sort alphabetically. Hopefully this is a feature I can add in the future.

To clone the repo, run:

git clone https://github.com/sophxe/roll_initiative

On Linux/Unix systems,to make the script executable if it's not already, run:

chmod +x roll_initiative.py

To run the script, in the terminal change into the directory you cloned the repo into, and then run (on Linux/Unix, assuming Python 3 is already installed):

./roll_initiative.py


On Windows systems, Python 3 will need to be installed first, which can be downloaded from:

https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/



To run the script on Windows (from the command prompt, having changed into the directory you cloned the repo into):

roll_initiative.py
