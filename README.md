# ROLL INITIATIVE

A simple Python script to determine the order of initiative in D&D from inputted player names and initiative rolls:

Please note, the script does not determine tiebreakers with initiative modifiers in the event of a matched roll - it will sort alphabetically. Hopefully this is a feature I can add in the future.

To clone the repo, run:

git clone sophxe/roll_initiative

On Linux/Unix systems, to make the script executable, run:

chmod +x roll_initiative.py

To run the script, run from terminal:

./roll_initiative.py
